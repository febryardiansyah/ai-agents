## Getting started
Before you run the app make sure to set up the **API KEY**. If you don't have already one, you can create it in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

#### ⚠️ Important
Make sure to include your API key using the `--dart-define` flag.

If you use VSCode, you can  [specify  `--dart-define`  variables](https://dartcode.org/docs/using-dart-define-in-flutter/)  in your launch.json file.

If you use Android Studio or IntelliJ you can use run / debug configurations ([https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/run-debug-configuration.html](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/run-debug-configuration.html)).
